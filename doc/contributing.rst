How to contribute to ICARO
=======================

Prepare github
--------------

- `Get a github account
  <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/>`_
  if you do not already have one.

- `Upload your SSH key
  <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/>`_, if
  you have not already done so.

Prepare your repositories
-------------------------


- Fork the ICARO repository in GitHub.

- Clone your fork in your local disk.

- set nextic as *upstream*

Use a higher-level git interface
--------------------------------

We believe that the best option is to use `magit <https://magit.vc/>`_ to interact with git: `it's the best git UI <https://magit.vc/quotes/>`_ on the
planet. Magit runs on emacs and we recommend it even if you use another editor. Think of Emacs as the GUI framework in which magit is written.

You will enjoy and learn to understand git much more if you use magit (and besides, *it's free*)

[If you use Mac OS or Windows and want to pay for a commercial product, While
https://www.git-tower.com/ seems a reasonable alternative. Otherwise, Just use magit.]

To make the magit experience even better, use
`helm <https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/>`_.
